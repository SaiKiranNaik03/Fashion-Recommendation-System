# Fashion Recommendation System

## 🚀 Overview
The Fashion Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that suggests fashion items to users based on image similarity. The system leverages deep learning techniques to extract features from images and provides recommendations based on those features.

## 🔥 Features  
- Recommends visually similar fashion products based on input images.  
- Utilizes **CNN ResNet-50** for feature extraction.  
- Implements **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for finding similar products.  
- Processes a dataset of **44,000+ fashion product images**.  
- Uses **Pickle** to store trained model data for efficient retrieval.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (ResNet-50 for feature extraction)  
- **Scikit-learn** (KNN implementation)  
- **Streamlit** (for building a user-friendly interface)  
- **Pickle** (for storing trained features and model)
